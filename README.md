# Judges-Perceptions-of-AI-in-Courts
We employ a questionnaire to investigate judges' perceptions of the application of AI in the judicial field. 

These cover the following topics: judges' support for AI in the judicial field, judges' understanding of the boundaries of AI application in judicial tasks, judges' attitudes toward AI in case analysis, judges' perceptions of AI's role in case adjudication, judges' views on the ethical implications and limitations of AI in judicial scenarios, and judges' perceptions of AI's impact on judicial efficiency and quality. For each question, judges may select one or more options.

The results of the questionnaire can be found in the file 
[The results of Questionnaire.pdf](./The%20results%20of%20Questionnaire.pdf).
